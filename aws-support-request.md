# AWS Support Request - Remove Closed Accounts

## Issue
I have 3 closed AWS accounts in my organization that are preventing me from creating new accounts due to the account limit. The accounts are:

- Account ID: 552993617595 (security@tadeumendonca.io) - Status: SUSPENDED/CLOSED
- Account ID: 310485116816 (audit@tadeumendonca.io) - Status: SUSPENDED/CLOSED  
- Account ID: 988779896629 (log-archive@tadeumendonca.io) - Status: SUSPENDED/CLOSED

## Request
Please remove these closed accounts from my organization immediately so I can create new accounts for my AWS Landing Zone implementation.

## Organization Details
- Organization ID: o-fqyu2eameb
- Master Account ID: 858049036700
- Master Account Email: tedtalkstome@outlook.com

## Business Justification
I'm implementing an AWS Landing Zone with proper account separation for security, logging, and auditing. These closed accounts are blocking my ability to create the required accounts for this security best practice implementation.
